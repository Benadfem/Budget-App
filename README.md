💰 Wealth-Pilot: Full-Stack Financial Ecosystem

Developed by Adedara Benson (Benadfem)
B.Sc. Computer Science | Harvard CS50P Certified | Agentic Systems Architect

📖 Project Overview

Wealth-Pilot is a professional-grade financial management ecosystem. It bridges the gap between modern mobile user interfaces and robust, high-performance Python backends.

Originally built as a standalone Flutter Budget App, this project has been evolved into a Full-Stack Agentic Architecture to meet 2026 industry standards for FinTech applications.

🏗️ System Architecture

The system is divided into two distinct modules to ensure scalability and professional separation of concerns:

1. 📱 Mobile Frontend (/mobile_app)

Framework: Flutter & Dart.

Purpose: High-performance, cross-platform UI for real-time expense tracking and budget visualization.

Logic: Communicates with the Python Backend via RESTful API calls.

1. 🧠 Agentic Backend (/backend)

Framework: Python 3.14 & FastAPI.

Core Engine: A robust Transaction Engine (upgraded from core banking logic) that handles interest calculations, balance states, and secure withdrawals.

Reliability: Powered by Pydantic V3 for strict data validation and Harvard-style Pytest suites for 100% logic verification.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Layer	Technologies	Key Mastery

Backend	Python (Asyncio), FastAPI	System Design & API Architecture
Logic	Pydantic, Pytest (CS50P Standards)	Data Integrity & Unit Testing
AI (Roadmap)	LangGraph, Agentic Orchestration	Autonomous Decision-Making
🚦 Getting Started
Backend Setup (Python)

Navigate to /backend.

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the server: uvicorn main:app --reload

Run tests: pytest

Mobile Setup (Flutter)

Navigate to /mobile_app.

Get packages: flutter pub get

Run on device: flutter run

📈 2026 Roadmap: The "Agentic" Evolution

This project is currently being upgraded to include an Autonomous Financial Advisor.

Phase 1: Core Flutter UI development.

Phase 2: Migration to FastAPI Backend with Pydantic validation.

Phase 3: Integration of LangGraph to allow the app to "reason" about spending habits.

Phase 4: Deployment to AWS using Cloud-native CI/CD pipelines.

🛡️ Professional Standards

This repository adheres to the Clean Code principles taught in Harvard's CS50P, ensuring that every financial transaction is validated, tested, and secure.
